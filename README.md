## History
This was meant to be used in a public school to make easier and more intuitive storing and visualizing the data about employees work, to replace the old program they used but that school closed and probably there is a lot of programs better than I could ever do, so I stopped entirely.

This is highly unlikely you will find this useful because this project is its very first stage.
