## History
This was meant to be used in a school to make easier and more intituive storing and visualising the data about employees work, to replace the old program they used but that school closed and probably there is a lot of programs better that I could ever done, so I stopped enterily.

This is highly unlikely as this project is its very first stages but If you find this useful you are free to use it.
